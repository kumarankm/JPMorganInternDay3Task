# JPMorganInternDay3Task
My third day of internship is to display data visually for traders and used Perspective to create the chart for the traderâ€™s dashboard and made some changes in the code and then created the patch file for this code and here comes my JPMorgan to an end. Thanks for JPMorgan and InsideSherpa for providing this virtual experience
